# Finland's municipalities in TopoJSON format

The municipalities list is up to date as of September 2017.

The municipalities are inside an object called `kuntarajat`. Each municipality
has a `properties` object with `code` (string id) and `name` fields.

## Usage

Convert the TopoJSON to GeoJSON using (topojson)[https://github.com/topojson/topojson]:

```js
import { feature } from 'topojson';

const geoJSON = feature(
  municipalitiesTopoJSON,
  municipalitiesTopoJSON.objects.kuntarajat,
);
```

## Source

The file was generated by simplifying https://github.com/tomimick/mapcolorizer/blob/master/data-finland/data/kuntarajat.geojson
using http://mapshaper.org/. Since the source data contained old municipalities
that no longer exist, these were combined with the correct neighbouring
municipalities with the following command:

```
topomerge kuntarajat=kuntarajat -k '["476", "174"].indexOf(d.properties.code) > -1 ? "297" : "532" === d.properties.code ? "398" : "283" === d.properties.code ? "098" : "164" === d.properties.code ? "301" : "413" === d.properties.code ? "609" : "442" === d.properties.code ? "051" : "319" === d.properties.code ? "783" : "838" === d.properties.code ? "423" : d.properties.code' < finland-municipalities-topojson.json > finland-municipalities-topojson-new.json
```

Once merged, the `properties` object (with `code` and `name`) needed to be added
to the combined shapes manually.
